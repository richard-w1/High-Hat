# 🎨 Frontend Integration Complete!

## Overview

I've integrated the new database models (Sessions, Incidents, Frames) with the frontend dashboard. The dashboard now displays real-time session info and a comprehensive table of all past sessions with expandable incident details.

---

## ✅ What Was Added

### **1. New API Endpoints**

Added to `real_ai_app.py`:

```python
GET /api/sessions                  # Get all sessions
GET /api/sessions/<session_id>     # Get session with all incidents
GET /api/incidents/<incident_id>   # Get incident with frames & analyses
```

### **2. Current Session Card**

When monitoring is active, shows:
- **Session ID** - Current session number
- **Duration** - How long monitoring has been running
- **Total Frames** - Frames processed so far
- **Incidents** - Number of incidents detected
- **Escalations** - Number of threats analyzed

### **3. Sessions & Incidents Table**

Replaces the old audit table with a hierarchical view:

**Session Row** (clickable to expand):
- Session ID
- Started timestamp
- Duration
- Total frames
- Incident count
- Escalation count
- Status (Active/Completed)
- Actions (View button)

**Expanded Incidents** (shown when session clicked):
- Incident ID
- Threat badge (if detected)
- Duration
- Frame count
- Max hand count
- Max confidence
- Threat explanation
- Details button

## 📊 Features

### **Session Filtering**
- **All Sessions** / **Active** / **Completed**
- **All Threats** / **Threat Detected** / **Safe**
- **Date filter** - Filter by start date

### **Expandable Rows**
- Click any session row to expand/collapse
- Shows all incidents within that session
- Loads incident data on-demand (not preloaded)

### **Pagination**
- 10 sessions per page
- Previous/Next buttons
- Page counter

### **Real-time Updates**
- Current session card updates every 2 seconds
- Sessions table refreshes automatically
- No page reload needed

---

## 🎯 User Workflow

### **1. Start Monitoring**
```
User clicks "Start Monitoring"
  ↓
Current Session Card appears
  - Shows Session #1
  - Duration: 0s
  - Frames: 0
  - Incidents: 0
  - Escalations: 0
```

### **2. During Monitoring**
```
Hand detected → Incident created
  ↓
Current Session Card updates:
  - Incidents: 1
  - Frames: increasing
  
Sessions table shows:
  - Session #1 (Active)
  - Click to expand → shows Incident #1
```

### **3. Threat Detected**
```
Gemini confirms threat
  ↓
Incident marked with red "THREAT" badge
  ↓
Escalations counter increments
  ↓
Threat explanation displayed under incident
```

### **4. Stop Monitoring**
```
User clicks "Stop Monitoring"
  ↓
Current Session Card disappears
  ↓
Sessions table shows:
  - Session #1 (Completed)
  - Final stats displayed
```

### **5. View Past Sessions**
```
Scroll through sessions table
  ↓
Click any past session to expand
  ↓
See all incidents from that session
  ↓
Click "Details" on any incident
  ↓
(TODO: Opens modal with frames & Gemini analyses)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **State Management**

```javascript
// Global state
let allSessions = [];           // All sessions from API
let filteredSessions = [];      // After applying filters
let currentSessionPage = 1;      // Pagination state
let expandedSessions = new Set(); // Which sessions are expanded
```

### **Data Flow**

```
1. refreshData() called every 2 seconds
   ↓
2. Fetch /api/session (current session)
   ↓
3. If active → Update currentSessionCard
   ↓
4. Always call refreshSessions()
   ↓
5. Fetch /api/sessions (all sessions)
   ↓
6. Apply filters → renderSessions()
   ↓
7. Generate HTML for session rows
   ↓
8. If expanded → fetch /api/sessions/<id>
   ↓
9. Render incidents inline
```

### **Performance Optimizations**

- ✅ **Lazy Loading** - Incidents only loaded when session expanded
- ✅ **Pagination** - Only 10 sessions rendered at once
- ✅ **Debouncing** - Filter changes reset to page 1
- ✅ **Efficient DOM Updates** - innerHTML for batch updates

## 📋 Data Structure Examples

### **Session Object**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "started_at": "2025-10-05T14:23:10Z",
  "ended_at": "2025-10-05T14:28:45Z",
  "is_active": false,
  "total_frames": 1250,
  "total_incidents": 3,
  "total_escalations": 1,
  "duration_seconds": 335
}
```

### **Incident Object**
```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "session_id": 1,
  "started_at": "2025-10-05T14:25:30Z",
  "ended_at": "2025-10-05T14:25:52Z",
  "is_active": false,
  "total_frames": 45,
  "max_hand_count": 2,
  "max_confidence": 0.95,
  "is_escalated": true,
  "threat_detected": true,
  "threat_confidence": 85.5,
  "threat_explanation": "Hand reaching toward backpack, potential theft attempt",
  "duration_seconds": 22
}
```
